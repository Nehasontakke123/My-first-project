    <h1>MERN</h1><hr>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)"></a><img src="https://www.gadget-rumours.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MERN.jpg" alt="MERN logo" height="340" width="340"/></a>
    <p>MERN stack is a software stack that includes four open-source technologies: (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and
        Node.js). These components provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web sites and web applications.

        Among these technologies MongoDB is a database system, Node.js is a server-side runtime environment, Express.js
        is a web framework for Node.js and React is a client-side JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.

        Because all components of the MERN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, MERN applications can
        be written in one programming language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.</p>
    <h2>Software components</h2><hr>
    <h3>MongoDB</h3>
    <p>MongoDB is a NoSQL database program that uses JSON-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON">BSON</a> (binary JSON) documents with schema. <br>

        The role of the database in the MERN stack is very commonly filled by MongoDB because its use of JSON-like
        documents for interacting with data as opposed to the row/column model allows it to integrate well with the
        other (JavaScript-based) components of the stack.</p>
    <h3>Express.js</h3>
    <p>Express.js (also referred to as Express) is a modular web application framework for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">Node.js.</a> <br>

        Whilst Express is capable of acting as an internet-facing web server, even supporting SSL/TLS out of the box, it
        is often used in conjunction with a reverse proxy such as NGINX or Apache for performance reasons.</p>
    <h3>React</h3>
    <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is
        maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

        React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only
        concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use of
        additional libraries for state management and routing.Redux and React Router are respective examples of
        such libraries.</p>
    <h3>Node.js</h3>
    <p>Node.js is the application runtime that the MEAN stack runs on.

        The use of Node.js, which is said to represent a "JavaScript Everywhere" paradigm, is integral to the MEAN
        stack which relies on that concept.</p>
