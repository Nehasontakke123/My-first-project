    <h1>Infosys</h1>
    <p><strong>Infosys Limited</strong> is an Indian multinational information technology company that provides business consulting,
        information technology and outsourcing services. The company was founded in Pune and is headquartered in
        Bangalore. Infosys is the second-largest Indian IT company, after Tata Consultancy Services, by 2020 revenue
        figures.

        On 24 August 2021, Infosys became the fourth Indian company to reach US$100 billion in market capitalization. It
        is one of the top Big Tech (India) companies.</p>

    <h2>History</h2><hr>
    <p>Infosys was founded by seven engineers in Pune, Maharashtra, India, with an initial capital of $250. It was
        registered as Infosys Consultants Private Limited on 2 July 1981. In 1983, it relocated to Bangalore,
        Karnataka.

        The company changed its name to Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and to Infosys Technologies
        Limited when it became a public limited company in June 1992. It was renamed Infosys Limited in June
        2011.

        An initial public offering (IPO) was floated in February 1993 with an offer price of ₹95 (equivalent to ₹690 or
        US$8.60 in 2023) per share against a book value of ₹20 (equivalent to ₹150 or US$1.80 in 2023) per share. The
        IPO was undersubscribed but it was "bailed out" by US investment bank Morgan Stanley, which picked up a 13%
        equity stake at the offer price. Its shares were listed in June 1993 with trading opening at ₹145
        (equivalent to ₹1,100 or US$13 in 2023) per share.

        Infosys shares were listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 1999 as American depositary receipts (ADR). It became
        the first Indian company to be listed on Nasdaq.<sup>[citation needed]</sup> The share price surged to ₹8,100 (equivalent
        to ₹35,000 or US$440 in 2023) by 1999, making it the costliest share on the market at the time. At that time,
        Infosys was among the 20 biggest companies by market capitalization on the Nasdaq. The ADR listing was
        shifted from Nasdaq to NYSE Euronext to give European investors better access to the company's shares.

        In July 2010, then-British Prime Minister David Cameron visited Infosys HQ in Bangalore and addressed Infosys
        employees.

        In 2012, Infosys announced a new office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to serve Harley-Davidson. Infosys hired
        1,200 United States employees in 2011 and expanded the workforce by 2,000 employees in 2012.

        In April 2018, Infosys announced expansion in Indianapolis, Indiana.

        In July 2014, Infosys started a product subsidiary called EdgeVerve Systems, focusing on enterprise software
        products for business operations, customer service, procurement and commerce network domains. In August
        2015, assets from Finacle Global Banking Solutions were transferred from Infosys, thus becoming part of the
        product company EdgeVerve Systems' product portfolio.

        Its annual revenue surpassed US$10 million in FY 1995, US$100 million in FY 1999, US$1 billion in FY 2004, and
        US$10 billion in FY 2017. Its most up to date report, as of December 2023, shows US$18 billion.</p>

    <h3>Settlement of tax fraud in the US</h3>
    <p>In December 2019, the Attorney General of California, Xavier Becerra announced an $800,000 settlement against
        Infosys and its BPM (business process management) subsidiary. Close to 500 Infosys employees were working in the
        state on Infosys-sponsored B-1 visas instead of H-1B visas between 2006 and 2017, as per an official post
        available on the website of State of California.

        This misclassification resulted in Infosys avoiding California payroll taxes such as unemployment insurance,
        disability insurance, and employment training taxes.</p>
    <h3>Accusation of visa fraud in the US</h3>
    <p>In 2011, Infosys was accused of committing visa fraud by using B-1 (visitor) visas for work requiring H-1B (work)
        visas. The allegations were initially made by an American employee of Infosys in an internal complaint. He
        subsequently sued the company, claiming that he was harassed and sidelined after speaking out. Although that
        case was dismissed it, along with another similar case, brought the allegations to the notice of
        the US authorities – and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury started
        investigating.

        In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with US authorities by paying US$34 million.
        Infosys refused to admit guilt and stressed that it only agreed to pay the fine to avoid the nuisance of
        "prolonged litigation". In its statement, the company said "As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies
        and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse.
        Those claims are assertions that remain unproven".[</p>
    <h3>Malfunctioning income tax, GST and MCA portal</h3>
    <p>From 2016 onwards, after Infosys took over the contract from Tata Consultancy Services stakeholders complained
        about malfunctioning and low performance of portals multiple times. The Income Tax portal went down on the due
        date of multiple tax periods and taxpayers ended up paying late fees and penalties, and the government allowed
        the extension of due dates because of this.

        Chartered accountants and Company secretaries raised issues with MCA portal on due dates. Many companies became
        liable for additional fees and fines due to non-compliance. This issue is turning opposite to Ease of doing
        business initiatives of Government of India.

        CAs and Tax professionals raised concerns about the flawed GST portal and their inability to rectify these
        issues.

        Government faced severe criticism from CAs, CSs and other stakeholders for its continuous failure to take action
        against Infosys and alleged that public fund is being heavily mis-utilised.[</p>
